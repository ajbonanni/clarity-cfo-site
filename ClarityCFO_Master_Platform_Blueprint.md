# ClarityCFO.ai: Master Platform Blueprint

This document provides a strategic blueprint for the ClarityCFO.ai platform, designed to integrate GenAI, AI agents, and best-in-class financial software. It outlines the ideal architecture to deliver smart, scalable, and automated financial services.

## 1. Platform Blueprint

## 2. Technology Stack by Phase

- Frontend: HTML, TailwindCSS, Vanilla JS
- Backend: Firebase Firestore, Firebase Storage, Firebase Auth
- AI: OpenAI GPT-4 or Claude for narrative generation
- Agentic AI: AutoGen, CrewAI, or LangGraph for orchestration
- File Parsing: PapaParse (CSV), SheetJS (XLSX), PDF.js (PDFs)
- Deployment: Vercel
- Email: Resend or SendGrid
- Auth: Firebase Authentication (Google OAuth or email/password)
- Monitoring: Sentry or LogRocket

## 3. Recommended Vendors and Tools

- GenAI: OpenAI (https://openai.com), Anthropic Claude (https://www.anthropic.com)
- AI Agents: CrewAI (https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI), AutoGen (https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)
- Financial Modeling: Jirav (https://www.jirav.com), Causal (https://www.causal.app), Mosaic (https://www.mosaic.tech)
- Upload/File Parsing: PapaParse, SheetJS, PDF.js
- Firebase Suite: https://firebase.google.com
- Deployment: https://vercel.com
- Email: https://resend.com or https://sendgrid.com

## 4. Warnings & Anti-Patterns

- Don’t use GenAI for precise number logic or reconciliation — use math.
- Don’t rely on GenAI to replace domain-specific tools like FP&A scenario builders.
- Don’t use Agents for 1-step tasks — they shine in multi-step orchestration.
- Use traditional logic (if-then, scoring, rule-based checks) where explainability matters.
- Avoid overlapping tools that compete (e.g., too many sources of truth).
